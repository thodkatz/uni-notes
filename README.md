**How should you take notes?**

It's all about questions, not answers! I think the most productive way to remember things is to remember the questions you had when you were trying to understand/learn a topic. Trying to remember things is when your memory is getting stronger. Also, answers nowadays can be found with the magic tools called search engines, but if you don't know what answers you have, how are you gonna search, pal? So, from now, **it's all about questions**
